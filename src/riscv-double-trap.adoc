Change is extremely unlikely. A high threshold will be used, and a change will
only occur because of some truly critical issue being identified during the
public review cycle. Any other desired or needed changes can be the subject of
a follow-on new extension.

== Double Trap

A double trap typically arises during a sensitive phase in trap handling
operations -- when an exception or interrupt occurs while the trap handler (the
component responsible for managing these events) is in a non-reentrant state.
This non-reentrancy usually occurs in the early phase of trap handling, wherein
the trap handler has not yet preserved the necessary state to handle and resume
from the trap. The occurrence of a trap during this phase can lead to an
overwrite of critical state information, resulting in the loss of data needed to
recover from the initial trap. The trap that caused this critical error
condition is henceforth called the _unexpected trap_. Trap handlers are designed
to neither enable interrupts nor cause exceptions during this phase of handling.
However, managing Hardware-Error exceptions cite:[PRIV], which may occur
unpredictably, presents significant challenges in trap handler implementation
due to the potential risk of a double trap.

The ISA Double Trap Extensions are devised to tackle situations where
conventional fault handling mechanisms fall short. Although a double trap
generally is an irrecoverable condition and signals a critical error, these
extensions introduce strategies to manage such errors across privilege levels.

The following ISA extensions are defined to enhance fault handling capabilities:

* Ssdbltrp: This extension is designed to address double trap at privilege modes
  lower than M. It enables HS-mode to invoke a critical error handler in a
  virtual machine on a double trap in VS-mode. It also allows M-mode to invoke a
  critical error handler in the OS/Hypervisor on a double trap in S/HS-mode. The
  Ssdbltrp extension is specified in <<SSDBLTRP>>.

* Smdbltrp: This extension addresses a double trap in M-mode. When the Smrnmi
  extension cite:[SMRNMI] is implemented, it enables invocation of the RNMI
  handler on a double trap in M-mode to handle the critical error. If the Smrnmi
  extension is not implemented or if a double trap occurs during the RNMI
  handler's execution, this extension helps transition the hart to a critical
  error state and enables signaling the critical error to the platform. To
  improve error diagnosis and resolution, this extension supports debugging
  harts in a critical error state. The Smdbltrp extension is specified in
  <<SMDBLTRP>>.

[[SSDBLTRP]]
=== Ssdbltrp Operational Details

The Ssdbltrp adds an S-mode-disable-trap (`SDT`) field (bit 24) to the `sstatus`
CSR and a double-trap-enable (`DTE`) field (bit 59) to the `menvcfg` CSR. If the
H-extension is implemented, Ssdbltrp also adds a `SDT` field (bit 24) to the
`vsstatus` CSR and a `DTE` field (bit 59) to the `henvcfg` CSR. The Ssdbltrap
extension requires the implementation of the `mtval2` CSR. An Exception Code
(value = 16) called the double trap is introduced. The bit 16 of the `medeleg`
and the `hedeleg` CSRs are read-only zero as the double trap is not delegatable.

When `menvcfg.DTE` is zero, the implementation behaves as though Ssdbltrp is not
implemented. When Ssdbltrp is not implemented `sstatus.SDT`, `vsstatus.SDT`, and
`henvcfg.DTE` bits are read-only zero. When `henvcfg.DTE` is zero, the
implementation behaves as though Ssdbltrp is not implemented for VS-mode and the
`vsstatus.SDT` bit is read-only zero.

When the `SDT` bit is set to 1 by an explicit CSR write, the `SIE` (Supervisor
Interrupt Enable) bit is cleared to 0. This clearing occurs regardless of the
value written, if any, to the `SIE` bit by the same write. The `SIE` bit can
only be set to 1 by an explicit CSR write if the `SDT` bit is being set to 0 by
the same write or is already 0.

When a trap is to be taken into VS- or S-mode, if the `SDT` bit is currently 0,
it is then set to 1, and the trap is delivered as expected. However, if `SDT` is
already set to 1, then this is an _unexpected trap_. In the event of an
_unexpected trap_, a double-trap exception trap is delivered into M-mode. To
deliver this trap, the hart writes registers, except `mcause` and `mtval2`, with
the same information that the _unexpected trap_ would have written if it was
taken into M-mode. The `mtval2` register is then set to what would be otherwise
written into the `mcause` register by the _unexpected trap_. The `mcause`
register is set to 16, the double-trap exception code.

An `SRET` instruction sets the `SDT` bit to 0.

[NOTE]
====
A trap handler after saving the state needed for resuming from the trap,
including `scause`, `sepc`, and `stval` among others, should clear the `SDT` bit
when it is reentrant.

Resetting of the `SDT` by an `SRET` enables the trap handler to detect double
trap occuring during the tail phase, where it restores critical state to return
from a trap.

The consequence of this specification is that if a critical error condition was
caused by a guest page-fault, then the GPA will not be available in `mtval2`
when the double trap is delivered to M-mode. This condition arises if the
HS-mode invokes a hypervisor virtual-machine load or store instruction when
`SDT` is 1 and the instruction raises a guest page-fault. The use of such an
instruction in this phase of trap handling is not common. However, not recording
the GPA is considered benign because, if required, it can still be obtained
-- albeit with added effort -- through the process of walking the page tables.

For a double trap originating in VS-mode, M-mode should redirect the exception
to HS-mode by copying the values of M-mode CSRs updated by the trap to HS-mode
CSRs and should use an `MRET` to resume execution at the address in `stvec`.

Supervisor Software Events (SSE) cite:[SSE], an extension to the SBI, provide a
mechanism for supervisor software to register and service system events
emanating from an SBI implementation, such as firmware or a hypervisor. In the
event of a double trap, HS-mode and M-mode can utilize the SSE mechanism to
invoke a critical-error handler in VS-mode or S/HS-mode, respectively.
Additionally, the implementation of an SSE protocol can be considered as an
optional measure to aid in the recovery from such critical errors.

[[SMDBLTRP]]
=== Smdbltrp Operational Details

The Smdbltrp extension adds an M-mode-disable-trap (`MDT`) field (bit 42) to the
`mstatus` CSR for RV64. For RV32, this field is located in the `mstatush` CSR at
bit position 10. Upon reset, the `MDT` field is set to 1. An Exception Code
(value = 16) called the double trap is introduced.

When the `MDT` bit is set to 1 by an explicit CSR write, the `MIE` (Machine
Interrupt Enable) bit is cleared to 0. For RV64, this clearing occurs regardless
of the value written, if any, to the `MIE` bit by the same write. The `MIE` bit
can only be set to 1 by an explicit CSR write if the `MDT` bit is already 0 or,
for RV64, is being set to 0 by the same write (For RV32, the `MDT` bit is
in `mstatush` and the `MIE` bit in `mstatus` register).

When a trap is to be taken into M-mode, if the `MDT` bit is currently 0, it is
then set to 1, and the trap is delivered as expected. However, if `MDT` is
already set to 1, then this is an _unexpected trap_. Additionally, when the
Smrnmi extension is implemented, a trap that occurs when executing in M-mode
with the `mnstatus.NMIE` set to 0 is an _unexpected trap_. The handling of an
_unexpected trap_ is as follows:

* When the Smrnmi extension is implemented and `mnstatus.NMIE` is 1, the hart
  traps to the RNMI handler. To deliver this trap, the `mnepc` and `mncause`
  registers are written with the values that the _unexpected trap_ would have
  written to the `mepc` and `mcause` registers respectively. The privilege
  mode information fields in the `mnstatus` register are written to indicate
  M-mode and its `NMIE` field is set to 0.

[NOTE]
====
The consequence of this specification is that on occurrence of double trap the
RNMI handler is not provided with information that a trap would report in the
`mtval` and the `mtval2` registers. This information, if needed, may be obtained
by the RNMI handler by decoding the instruction at the address in `mnepc` and
examining its source register contents.
====

* When the Smrnmi extension is not implemented, or if the Smrnmi extension is
  implemented and `mnstatus.NMIE` is 0, the hart enters a critical-error state
  without updating any architectural state including the `pc`. This state
  involves ceasing execution, disabling all interrupts (including NMIs), and
  asserting a `critical-error` signal to the platform.

[NOTE]
====
The actions performed by the platform on assertion of a `critical-error` signal
by a hart are platform specific. The range of possible actions include restarting
the affected hart or restarting the entire platform among others.
====

An `MRET` instruction sets the `MDT` bit to 0.

The Smdbltrp extension introduces a read-write critical-error-trigger (`cetrig`)
field (bit 19) to the `dcsr` CSR cite:[DBG]. When `cetrig` is set to 1, a hart
in a critical error state enters Debug Mode instead of asserting the
critical-error signal to the platform. Upon such entry into Debug Mode, the
`cause` field of `dcsr` is set to 7, and its `extcause` field is set to 0,
indicating a critical error triggered the Debug Mode entry. This cause has the
highest priority among all reasons for entering Debug Mode. Resuming from Debug
Mode following an entry from the critical error state returns the hart to the
critical error state.

[NOTE]
====
The implication of this specification is that resuming from Debug Mode,
following an entry due to a critical error, will either result in an immediate
re-entry into Debug Mode due to the critical error if `cetrig` is set to 1, or
it will cause the critical-error signal to be asserted to the platform.  The
debugger may resume with `cetrig` set to 0 to allow the platform defined actions
on critical-error signal to occur. Other possible actions include initiating a
hart or platform reset using the Debug Module reset control.
